# PROJECT RIMFACTORY TO-DO LIST
---

## Easy
- Crafting recipe for volatite chunk
- Make nutrient paste meal recipe

## Medium
- Quantum computer texture
- Finish Help system
- Make drones unforbid stuff after mining
- Post-goldbach and post-ordo storage
- Scenario - Paperclip entreprenur
- Bischoff (Steam Workshop) "could you make it so that drones remember their area restrictions after being recalled to the station? I like to recall them during battles but then have to manually set all their areas again which is annoying. Maybe a tab for drones (like the restrict tab for pawns) would help so we can easier keep track of them."

## WTF
- Better control over drones
- Recipe def mod extensions - COMPATIBILITY
- Atomic reconstructor with BillRepeatModes

## WHAT!??!?
- "A strange feeling washes over your colonists. They speculate that the psychic signals may have originated from your very own AI research bench. Maybe it's trying to tell you something..."
